CARE FOR WEAPONS: (might 2+) You are able to apply a bit of magic when caring for a weapon. When anyone wields a weapon under your care, they can spend an effort to have it ignore 4 points of armor.

Using this ability again dismisses the benefit on the previous cared for weapons. Actions, 1 minute.

CARE FOR ARMOR: (might 4+) you clean and care for your armor better than anyone.

Each point of effort spent allows you to care for an additional piece of armor. Using this ability again dismisses the benefit on the previous cared for armor. Actions, 1 minute.

## Tier 6
SUPERB CARE: when a piece of armor or weapon is under your care, it deals 1 additional point of damage or has 1 additional point of armor.
