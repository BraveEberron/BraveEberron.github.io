# Psiforged

Alternative version of the Warforged. The Psiforged were created to be masters of arcane and psychic energies.

# Starting Ability
MIND OF CRYSTAL AND METAL: your body contains many crystals, giving you an affinity for magic and psionics. You have +1 armor to resist mental attacks and your Intellect pool increases by 6 points.

LIVING CONSTRUCT: Even though you were constructed, you are a humanoid. You are immune to disease. You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you can ingest food or drink if you wish.

SPECIAL HEALING: Traditional healing skills, medicines, and techniques work only half as well for you. Each time you start at full health, the first 5 points of damage you take can never be healed in these ways or recovered normally. Instead, you must use repairing skills and abilities to restore those points. For example, if you start with a full Might Pool of 10 and take 8 points of damage, you can use recovery rolls to restore 3 points, but the remaining 5 points must be restored using repairing methods. The difficulty of the task is equal to the number of points of damage sustained.

# Marks available:
