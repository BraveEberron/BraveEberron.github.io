NEW CYRE—The Brelish Parliament is dragging its heels on better roads and other improvements that would make life easier for thousands of Cyran refugees in eastern Breland, said Prince Oargev ir’Wynarn, last heir to the fallen nation.

“Each day, Cyre’s children come home to New Cyre, and we greet them with muddy, nigh-impassible roads. Monsters from the Mournland continue to menace our settlements. But some do-nothings in Parliament won’t loosen the purse-strings and give a generous welcome to those set adrift by war,” he said.

The population of New Cyre and environs has swelled from a few dozen farmers to a teeming community of nearly five thousand since the end of the Last War. Most residents are former Cyrans who were beyond the nation’s borders on the Day of Mourning.

The population influx has strained eastern Breland’s resources, ir’Wynarn said. Specifically, the roads are in poor condition and border patrols are spread too thin to keep the refugees safe.

“These are brave people who lost everything in the Last War, and they just want a chance to raise their families and build a new future,” he said. “But we literally can’t get lumber wagons down the roads so they can build new homes for themselves and their children. Bandits are roaming the countryside preying on those who have little enough to begin with.”

A levy of additional soldiers for the Eastern Command languishes in committee, ir’Wynarn said. Road improvements slated for this past summer were delayed by minister’s order and won’t be reconsidered until spring.

But Laruna ir’Panalric, who represents the Brey Crossing region in Parliament, said that New Cyre’s growing pains are competing with other priorities for Parliament, including a general postwar rebuilding effort and continuing efforts to secure the Breland’s western border. She accused Oargev ir’Wynarn of exploiting sympathy for the plight of the refugees for political gain.

“The Day of Mourning was a tragedy for all of Khorvaire, and I’m proud of how Breland has opened its arms to former citizens of Cyre. I wish other nations shared Breland’s generous spirit,” she said.

“But Breland is trying to make its way in a new world—a peaceful one with an empty Galifaran throne. Oargev can’t expect us to reconstitute Cyre within our own borders. This is Breland, and it always will be,” she said.

Laruna ir’Panalric is a sponsor of proposed legislation that would limit the number of Cyrans living in eastern Breland. Told of her comments, Oargev ir’Wynarn said that Eastern Breland was being ill-served by some of its parliament members.

“Sadly, there are a few, in Parliament and elsewhere, who can’t accept that the Last War is over and still want to do battle with Cyre. To them I say: Do your worst—we survived the Day of Mourning, and we’ll survive your petty prejudice."
