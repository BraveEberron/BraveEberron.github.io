Team Rally has won the Race of the 8 Winds. After the disappearance of their flag bearers, Team Rally was nearly disqualified from competing. But a group of adventures stepped up to help them out.

## Murder in the Upper City
The final night of the festival saw the murder of the prominent Provost Bonal Geldem of Morgrave. His body was found on the bridge by the very winners of the Race. They were attacked by Bonal's killer but they luckily defended themselves. Quickly after the sounds of combat started, our city guards quickly entered the scene and took control.
