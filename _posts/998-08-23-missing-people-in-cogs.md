Over the last month as many as one hundred people have gone missing from the Cogs. Yet the council and the city guards have made no action to investigate or keep the peace. 

When asked for comment one city representative, who wished to remain anonymous, said this, "Sharn is just so large of a city that these disappearances are likely just a drunken fool falling into a dumpster." 

While over a hundred people is just a fraction of the crime committed in the city over a month, the families of the victims claim they saw them come home and no sign of kidnapping was present. This fact went unanswered by the interviewed council member. 

The Cogs have started to become agitated as the numbers grow. The Sharn Inquisitive is not one to take a political stance but if something is not done soon the Cogs may riot and then every district will have a greater problem.
