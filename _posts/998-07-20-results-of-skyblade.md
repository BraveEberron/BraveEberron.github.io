In a Suprising turn of events, the victor of the recent Skyblades tournament was a rider unknown to this town. Her matches began with the usual fair. 

Her first match was against the lowest ranked rider in the game. A swift victory followed the start as the opponent was poorly trained in combat and animal handling.

The next match was a spectacular event to behold. After exchanging a few blows, our heroine flew to the sky and made a dramatic maneuver by diving quickly. The House Cannith backed rider was surprised when his mount was demolished, the very wings that held it aloft torn asunder. He plummeted like he rode a hunk of metal, quickly and dangerously. But bystanders remained protected by the feather fall wards on the bridges.

In the final match, Grok, who many might have heard about in recent news for his controversial court ruling, was the final opponent. He was favored to win, a faster mount and large amount of training being a huge factor. After some unusual tactics by both challengers, Grok fell.
