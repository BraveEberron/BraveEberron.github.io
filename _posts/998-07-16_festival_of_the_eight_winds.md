In one week, The Festival of the Eight Winds returns after it's cancellation for the past five years due to the war and recovery efforts. But the locals have petitioned the mayor's office to bring back the festival. They even went to far as to gain public sponsorship from House Cannith and House Medani.

## Events
Along with the race, festivities include a great feast put on by House Ghallanda, several performances by the Entertainers and Artisan Guild, and much much more.

## The Race of the Eight Winds
The famous Race also returns. For those who have not heard of it, the race of the Eight Winds consists of teams on flying beasts, traveling around the city to each checkpoint and finally passing the finish line.

Returning this year is the last Victor of the race, Team Yar'len from the lower part of the city. This Scrappy crew of goblinoids are top pick for this year, but with the rule changes they could get disqualified quickly.

### Rules of the Race
While the race has a brutal past, with about a 20% death rate for racers, new rules have been mandated by the sponsors and city council. 

To begin with, you are now only allowed a practice crossbow and 12 bolts. Any other Weapons used or spells cast will result in disqualification. 

Having your mount attack other mounts is discouraged but unenforceable. 

The race is won by collecting eight flags dotted around the city and taking them back to the starting line. The flags can be collected in any order you wish.

A team consists of two fliers and 8 flag bearers. One flier is in charge of the beast while the other looks for dangers and the flags. The flag bearers are there to ensure that their team members get the flag, and that it is not stolen by other teams.

### Reward
The first team to pass the finish line will receive 500 gold and a surprise item from House Cannith.

### Sign Up
Sign up is open until the last moment. Teams are required to submit a name and 10 gold to enter. See your nearest message station for additional details.
