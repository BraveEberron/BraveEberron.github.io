> The Mark of Shadows benefits its bearer with both invasive scrying magic as well as illusory abilities used for deception

The schism that occurred during the Last War between the older house Phiarlan and its offshoot rebel House Thuranni (for more information see the entry on House Phiarlan) has caused the Mark of Shadow to develop within both groups. Both houses still use the marks and their non-magical skills for intelligence gathering, spying, and other covert activities while still pursuing mercantile wealth through entertainers and artisans of all kinds.

House Phiarlan controls the mysterious Artisans Guild. Outwardly a group of entertainers and companions, they are in reality a vast spy web operating throughout Breland, Thrane, and Aundair. House Thuranni and their Shadow Network are based in the Lhazaar Principalities who stretch their influence into Karrnath, Droaam, Q'Barra, and even into the ranks of the Emerald Claw, at the behest of the fickle princes. Both houses also employ unmarked spies, disguised as dancers, musicians, and artists.
