> Those who possess the Mark of Making can mend and create inanimate objects with its power.

`House Cannith` holds power over the Mark of Making and their `Tinkers Guild` is widely travelled and respected. The house also boasts a second guild, the `Fabricators Guild`, made up of members who possess lesser or greater dragonmarks and are able to not only mend broken items but create entirely new ones. Those who are not marked usually take on roles well off artisans or in rarer cases mundane tinkers.

## Least
**SKILL**: you are trained in crafting with a type of material. I.E. wood, metal.

## Ritual
### Least
**MAKE WHOLE**: you completely repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as strong as new. The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

## Lesser
**FABRICATE**: You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship. You can manipulate up to 20 cubic feet of material and an additional 10 cubic feet per effort point spent. Enabler.

## Greater
**TINKER**: you tinker with an artifact for a minute. The remainder of the day, the artifact operates as if one level higher and regains 2 charges. Enabler.
