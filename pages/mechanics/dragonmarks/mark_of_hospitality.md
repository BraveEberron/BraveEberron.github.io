> The Mark of Hospitality grants those who bear it powers related to both food and shelter.

House Ghallanda members bear the Mark of Hospitality and make use of their abilities both on their native plains as well as running the lucrative Hostelers Guild. While the guild may not own every inn and restaurant in town they do enforce strict standards that must match their own levels of quality and comfort. Those who lack dragonmarks within the house are still able to run some of the finest establishments in all of Khorvaire and, mark or no, members of House Ghallanda take pride in their services.

## Descriptor
**SMART**: +2 to your intellect pool.  
**SKILL**: you are trained in positive interaction.

## Least
**PURIFY FOOD AND DRINK**: (1 / day) you make spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. The food and drink must be within a short distance of you.

**HOSPITALITY**: you and your allies within 500 feet of you roll twice when resting and take the higher result. Enabler.

## Lesser
**CREATE FOOD AND DRINK**: (1 / day) The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice — highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a purify food and drink spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn’t go bad as the food does. You are able to create food for 12 creatures and 6 additional creatures per point of effort spent. Actions, 10 minute.

**PROTECT THE DREARY**: (1 / day) you designate a fire as a sentry in your stead. The fire will no go out due to a lack of fuel and will magically illuminate all area within a long distance. The light cannot be seen by a creature outside of that range unless you choose for them to be. If all allies are asleep, the fire is able to use your skills in perception to detect danger. Each two points of effort grants advantage to the fire.

## Greater
**HERO'S REST**: (1 / day) when taking the ten minutes, one hour, or ten hours rest, allies double the healing gained as long as they are within 500 feet. This benefit lasts for one rest. Enabler.
