> The Mark of Warding is used to protect people, places and things from all manner of damage or harm, with a focus on guarding locations and items from would-be thieves.

House Kundarak and its dwarf members possess the Mark of Warding, guarding not only their own belongings but also those of anyone who wants to be sure their possessions do not fall into others' hands. The Kundarak dwarves are careful businessmen but are also well-known for their honor; if you leave something in the care of House Kundarak, it stays safe. The Warding Guild also offers its services in security, keeping businesses and personal homes safe from unwanted intruders. Unmarked members often obtain jobs as trapmakers, security consultation, and more commonly with running the massive Kundarak bank.
