> The Mark of Detection gifts the marked with the ability to ferret out danger whether from an ambush or a cup of poisoned wine.

The House Medani half-elves are the bearers of this mark. The house began as a merchantile organization and is one of the youngest of the Dragonmarked Houses. Despite the fact that they have been in operation for many centuries some of the older houses still view them as upstarts.

The Warning Guild is well known for its personal protection services and anyone holding a meeting with less than trustworthy business partners would do well to spring for a member from the guild to attend. Members of the house who do not manifest the mark often serve as sentries and guards.
