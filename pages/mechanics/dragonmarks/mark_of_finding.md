> The Mark of Finding grants a marked creature with abilities related to locating people and objects.

House Tharashk, a family of humans and half-orcs who originated in the Shadow Marches, run House Tharashk and control the Finders Guild. The guild employs all manners of investigators, law enforcement agents as well as treasure and dragonshard hunters. Bounty hunters are also employeed by the guild and rumors hold that secret assassins are also on the pay roll for particularly hard to find enemies. Members of the house without dragonmarks are often mundane but highly skilled investigators as well as prospectors and guides.

## Descriptor
**SMART**: +2 to your intellect pool.  
**SKILL**: you are trained in searching for objects.

## Least
**IDENTIFY**: (1 / day) you determine all magic properties of a single magic item, including how to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any).

**LOCATE OBJECT**: (2 / day) you can declare an object you have seen or heard a fair description of. You know if the object is within 500 feet of you and the general direction to go. If the object is within an immediate distance, you are able to detect the exact location. This knowledge lasts for 10 minutes. Action.

## Lesser
**LOCATE CREATURE**: (1 / day) as locate Object but the target can make a DC 4 passive intellect defense to shake off the location. You can spend effort to increase the difficulty of the defense. A target that resists the spell cannot be targeted for until you take a ten hour rest. Action. 

**BECKON**: (1 / day) You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow. When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is. Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject. If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can’t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell. The hand lasts for 2 hours and an additional 2 hours for each effort spent. Action to initiate.

Distance | Time to Locate
---------|----------
 100 ft | 6 seconds 
 1000 ft | 1 minute
 1 mile | 10 minutes 
 2 mile | 1 hour 
 3 mile | 2 hours 
 4 mile | 3 hours
 5 mile | 4 hours

## Greater
**FIND THE PATH**: (1 / day) The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting. 

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding. The spell ends when the destination is reached or after 1 hour, whichever comes first. Each effort spent increases the duration by 1 hour.
