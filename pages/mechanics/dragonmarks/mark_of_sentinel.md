> The bearers of the Mark of Sentinel possess a number of powers designed to keep others from coming to harm. Heirs of House Deneith possess this mark.

The humans of House Deneith carry the Mark of Sentinel. They put their powers to use in the Defenders Guild, which offers comprehensive bodyguard services to persons of position and wealth. The house also provides sentinel marshals that have jurisdiction across national boundaries, but the Defenders Guild operates across Khorvaire.
