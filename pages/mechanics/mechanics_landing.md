# Stats, Tasks, Effort, Edge

## Stat Pools
**Might**: Your physical strength (Pathfinder: Str + Con).   
**Speed**: Your grace and dexterity (Pathfinder: Dex).  
**Intellect**: Your Mental prowess (Pathfinder: Wis + Int + Cha).  

## Tasks
**Task difficulty**: 0-10, difficulty 0 means no need to roll.  
**Rolling**: difficulty x3, d20 must meet or exceed that number. A difficulty 7+ is impossible (roll a 21) without modifying.  
 **Modifying**: -1 on difficulty means easier. *I.E. Difficulty 4 becomes 3*.  
 -  **Assets**: -1 per asset, max 2
-   **Inability**: +1 difficulty
-   **Trained/Specialized**: -1 / -2 respectively
-   **Advantage**: -1 difficulty
-   **Disadvantage**: +1 difficulty
 -  **Effort**: -1 difficulty per each spent

**Bonuses**: Some things give you +1 bonus to your die roll, three of these turn into an asset.  
**Initial Cost**: some tasks are so difficult they require an initial expense before a task can even be rolled, edge does still apply.    

### Special Rolls
- 1: GM Intrusion for free, but does not mean immediate failure
- 17: damage bonus +1 (combat only)
- 18: damage bonus +2 (combat only)
- 19: damage bonus +3 or minor effect
- 20: damage bonus +4 or major effect, regain points spent

## Effort
**Applying Effort**: 3 points from appropriate pool for first level on part of a task, 2 points for all levels after.  

### Uses for Effort
**Decrease Difficulty**: reduce the difficulty of a task by one for each level applied.  
**Increase Damage**: increase the damage of an attack by 3 for each level applied.  
**Increase Effect**: conditional.

## Edge
**Apply Edge**: Reduce the amount of points expended in a turn for a stat, each stat edge can only be used once for total reduction.

# Combat
**Initiative**: NPC level vs. Speed Task, Win go before, lose go after.  
**Turn**: Do a single Action, see Actions.

## Actions
Anything other than attacking provokes extra attack by all in immediate range unless only moving.

### Attack
**Circumstances**
- **High and Low**: If both melee and ranged attack succeed on single opponent in same round, opponents suffers +1 difficulty for next task.
- **Three-on-One**: If three characters attack a single foe in melee, they all gain 1 asset on attack.
- **Surprise**: if target had absolutely no idea of the attack, -2 difficulty, defender can spend no points or abilities
- **Partial Surprise**: target was on look out but did not see attack soon enough, -1 difficulty, defender can spend no points or use any abilities
- **Area Attack**: Roll single attack for all in range, defend normally
- **Modify Range**: +2 difficult for each multiplier to range. *I.E. Range weapon (Xft), 2Xft +2, 3Xft +4, 4Xft +6*

**Additional Modifiers**: See page 204 for more, situational
**Missing**: regain points spend on effort, not on ability though
**Damage**: *See Damage*
**Modify Damage**: spend an effort to increase the damage of an attack by 3

### Activate Special Ability
Roll a check to hit/activate depending on situation.  

**Modifying an ability on the Fly**: Abilities can be modified to do something that is unintended by rolling a separate task roll. This is at GM discretion but falls into following categories:
- **Impossible** (10): Modify ability to accomplish an effect that has nothing to do with its description. *I.E. use hover to shoot a fireball*
- **Formidable** (7): modify ability to do something similar to the description or intent, but changing its nature. *I.E. use hover to slam an opponent*
- **Difficult** (4): modify an ability to do something the spirit and general idea of the ability. *I.E. Use hover on an ally*

### Move
*See Movement*

### Defend
*Special: Not taken on your turn*
**Defense**: Attack Level vs. Relevant Task
- **Physical Attack**: Speed Task (Pathfinder: Reflex)
- **Poison Attack**: Might Task (Pathfinder: Fortitude)
- **Mental Attack**: Intellect Task (Pathfinder: Willpower)

### Do Something Else
**Cooperative Actions**:
- **Helping**: Take action to help, if better they gain asset, if worse they gain +1 bonus
- **Covering Fire**: On successful covering fire attack roll, foe’s next attack suffers disadvantage.
- **Distract**: Foe’s attacks suffer disadvantage. (Multiple distractions do not stack.)
- **Draw the Attack**: Intellect task (optional), on success NPC attacks you. (Prominent character suffers +1 difficulty on defense.)
- **Guarding**: Gain advantage on defense tasks. Can attempt reactive Speed task (-1 difficulty) to prevent characters from getting past or taking the action they’re guarding against. (NPCs on guard force PCs to make Speed task (+1 difficulty) to attempt the action.)
- **Take the Attack**: Speed task (optional), on success attack automatically hits you for +1 damage.
- **Wait**: Select a trigger action and resolve your action when the trigger occurs.

**Gain Insight**: Intellect 3, action, special, see page 216 for more info
Absolutely true fact usable for a plan. I.E. You know the guards that are normally there get drunk at 9pm and by 10 are passed out.  
**Retry Skill**: to retry you must apply one level of effort more than your previous attempt.

## Movement
**Action**: Move
- **Immediate (10 ft)**: Part of another action
- **Short (50 ft)**: 1 action
- **Long (100 ft)**: Speed task 4 & 1 action
- **Short + Action**: Speed task 4, fail only short move

**Chase**: NPC level vs. Speed Task
*Long Chase: Win # of speed tasks = to NPC level, more fail than success = failed chase*.  
**Climbing**: Terrain Difficulty vs. Might Task.  
**Long Jump**: # feet to jump - 4 vs. Might Task.  
*Running immediate distance = asset*.  
*Running short distance = asset, difficulty ½ # feet jumped - 4*.  
**Vertical Jump**: # feet to jump vs. Might Task. Running immediate distance = asset.  
**Sneaking**: NPC Level vs. Speed Task, +1 difficulty for more than half speed.  
**Swimming**: ¼ movement, +1 difficulty to move long/short*.  
**Moving Heavy Objects**: Weight / 50 vs. Might Task immediate distance, if difficulty 0 than short distance as action.  

**Movement Modifier**
Rough Terrain: ½ movement, +1 difficulty to move long/short.  

# Damage
Taking damage subtracts points from your relevant stat pool. If stat pool is zero then subtract from next pool in the line, damage still counts as coming from the original pool.  
Might -> Speed -> Intellect

## Weapons
**Unarmed/Light Weapon**: 2 damage, -1 attack difficulty  
**Medium Weapon**: 4 damage  
**Heavy Weapon**: 6 damage, requires two-hands  

## Armor
You subtract armor from damage you would take, certain damage types ignore certain types of armor. *I.E. mental damage ignores physical armor*. 
Physical armor reduces the Speed Pool of its user by twice the rating. This can be reduced by abilities.  
- **Light**: 1 armor
- **Medium**: 2 armor
- **Heavy**: 3 armor
- **Shield**: -1 speed defense difficulty

## Recovery
*1d6+tier+bonus*, divide into any number of pools.  
Roll : Rest Time
- **First** : 1 action
- **Second** : 10 minutes
- **Third** : 1 hour
- **Forth** : 10 hours

### Healing Skill
Intellect task, difficulty # of points healed, only once per day, can retry on fail.  

## Damage Track
- **Hale** : No Penalties
- **Impaired** : Ignore major/minor effects, 17+rolls only +1 damage, Effort costs +1 per level
- **Debilitated** : Cannot take action other than move immediate distance, if speed pool = 0 no move
- **Dead** : Dead

### Restoring the Damage Track
**Normal**: Raise a pool above 0.  
**Special**: Recovery Roll (no point recovery).  

## Special Damage
**Dazed**: +1 difficulty on all actions.  
**Stunned**: No actions.  
**Poison/Disease**: Might roll, fail means effect happens.  
**Paralysis**: No move, no physical action.  
**Ambient Damage**: not affected by armor.  
**Lasting Damage**: GM Intrusion, heal 1 point / day of full rest (or 3 days of activity).  
**Permanent Damage**: Special, never heals normally.
