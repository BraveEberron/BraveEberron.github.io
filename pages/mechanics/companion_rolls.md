The traditional roll for NPC vs NPC conflict is to have the one with the higher level always win. But some stories require NPC companions to accompany you and some foci give you faithful companions. In this system, they are of little use outside of a narrow range of events. TO help this, two systems has been created to allow a player in control of an NPC to make rolls for them in certain situations. This will mostly effect combat but can be used outside of combat to resolve suspenseful moments.

You can choose to use either of these systems when deciding what the companion will do in combat. If the companion is attacked, it is up to the GM to decide if Companion Rolls is used for defense or if the traditional rule is used.

## Version 1 - Companion Rolls
When a companion attempts to attack an npc, they make a roll with a base difficulty of 3. The companion's attack is modified by the difference in the levels of both parties.

For example: Trevor, a merc hired to help the party is level 2. He attacks a Hell Hound of level 4. So to attack or defend, who ever rolls for Trevor's task would need to make a DC 5 task (3 base & 4-2). Skills of either party still count. Since Trevor is trained in attacking and is using a light weapon, he reduces the difficulty of attacking back down to 3.

## Version 2 - Companion Aid
To streamline Companion use, you can consider the them to be aiding. This aid is dependent on level of the companion. See the table below for values.
- Companion Level 1-2: +1 to the roll of whatever action is being assisted (or, if in combat, damage)
- Companion Level 3-4: +2 to the roll of whatever action is being assisted (or, if in combat, damage)
- Companion Level 5-7: Difficulty of whatever action is being assisted is reduced by one step (or, if desired and in combat, +3 damage)
- Companion Level 8-10: Difficulty of whatever action is being assisted is reduced by one step (and if in combat, +1 damage)
