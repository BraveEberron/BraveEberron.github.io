# Karma
Karma is a new mechanic in this system. For this game, GM Intrusions no longer give you XP, instead you gain karma.

Below is a list of what to spend kaema. Because of the changes to XP, karma is meant to be spent on short term things.

## Prevent Disaster: 1 karma
- reroll a die, take better result
- prevent GM Intrusion

## Player Intrusion: 2 karma
Player Intrusions are another new mechanic added to the system. For those familiar with Fate, it works similar to that.

At any time, a player is able to propose a Player Intrusion. This involves naming an aspect of an object, location, or creature and describing how it effects the world. Later, examples are provided. The results might not always be exactly what you thought would happen, but it is a tool to give the players some story telling power outside of pure mechanics.

### Aspects
You can have multiple aspects and they are gained through your characters actions. You start with an aspect based on your Descriptor and Focus.

### Examples

Example 1. Jay is attempting to calm a crowd of angry villagers who believe that a friend of Jay's is a witch. Jay has the Smooth talker Descriptor, so he can spend his karma to propose that he is able to create a string of logic that lead to the villagers deciding that the accused is not a witch. But his logic does not work exactly as he expected, instead of burning, they attempt to discover if she floats. Hope she can swim.

Example 2. Gwen has the mark of handling and is attempting to catch up with an assassin. She can pay a karma to propose that her horse has a sudden burst of speed as it reacts to her wishes. Helping her close what would have been an impossible task. This does not let her directly catch her prey, only get close enough to try something.
