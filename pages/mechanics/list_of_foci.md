Some foci have been renamed for setting flavor. For Example, Battles Robots is called Hunts Warforged, each of its abilities now deal with Warforged and their like.

If you find a focus that you like that is not on this list, or would like to modify it, ask your GM. Cypher System easily allows for foci to be tailored to suite what the player wants.
