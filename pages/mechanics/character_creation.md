To create your character, you build a simple statement that describes him or her. The statement takes this form: “I am a [fill in an adjective here] [fill in a noun here] who [fill in a verb here].”

Thus: “I am an adjective noun who verbs.” For example, you might say, “I am a Rugged warrior who Controls Beasts” or “I am a Charming explorer who Focuses Mind over Matter.”

In this sentence, the adjective is called your descriptor.  
The noun is your character type.  
The verb is called your focus.  

Even though character type is in the middle of the sentence, that’s where we’ll start this discussion. (Just as in a sentence, the noun provides the foundation.)

## Type
Your character type is the core of your character. In some roleplaying games, it might be called your character class. Your type helps determine your character’s place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

You can choose from four character types in chapter 5: _warriors_, _adepts_, _explorers_, and _speakers_.

## Descriptor
Your descriptor defines your character — it colors everything you do. Your descriptor places your character in the situation (the first adventure, which starts the campaign) and helps provide motivation. It’s the adjective of the sentence “I am an adjective
noun who verbs.”

## Focus
Focus is what your character does best. Focus gives your character specificity and provides interesting new abilities that might come in handy. Your focus also helps you understand how you relate with the other player characters in your group. It’s the verb of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

## Race
In addition to the first three choices, you need to pick a race. This will effect how NPCs see you and what options are available to you. Some races have special abilities they can take like flavors and some have exclusive access to dragonmarks.

## Miscellaneous

### Skills
Depending on your choices, you might be given the option to choose skills. The Cypher System has no definitive list of skills. However, a list has been compiled to give you ideas.

### Background
Lastly, while not listed in the book. I would like you to create a backstory and answer a few questions to help me understand your character.  
The backstory does not need to be long, and the book provides starting ideas for each descriptor and focus.
