Some Halflings have traded the nomadic lifestyle of the Talenta Halfling for a more urban approach living in major cities across Khorvaire. While many of these halflings are associated with one of the two dragonmarked houses some are simply independent halflings wanting something different for their lives. Some urban halflings have never seen their native homeland, while others (mostly those associated with the dragonmarked houses) switch between city clothes and nomadic traditions depending on where they find themselves. There is a fine line between the halflings embracing their homeland and heritage and remaining truly neutral as all dragonmarked houses are charged to be.
