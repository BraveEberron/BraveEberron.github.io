Gnomes are harmless industrious folk... or so they want people to think. The gnomish homeland of Zilargo attained its independence from Breland at the start of the Last War by announcing itself an ally of Breland. It seems no one realized that Breland surrendered sovereignty over the territory in the process.
It was also the gnomes of House Sivis that anticipated the commercial impact of Dragonmarks and formed them into an extended network of industrial monopolies.
Gnomes might be small and jovial, but they are far more cunning and shrewd than they let on.
