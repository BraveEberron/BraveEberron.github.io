Dwarves are widely accepted across Khorvaire and receive little prejudice as they make a large minority in every nation. Dwarves can be found in all lines of work, from Inquisitives to bankers to smiths and politicians. Dwarves are sometimes stereotyped as money obsessed alcoholics, which is far from the truth, at least for some. Dwarves hold their family and clans dear to them, so dear that throughout their history they have fought amongst each other and even to this day the Dwarven clans hold grudges. Dwarves now live all over Khorvaire and even in Riedra.

The Dwarves of the Mror Holds endlessly mine for gems and metals in the Ironroot Mountains which has led to the clans becoming exceedingly wealthy. The clans of the Mror Holds have little power over Khorvaire however, a saying amongst Dwarves is that the one who really rules a kingdom is not the one on the throne but the one who keeps the kingdom's purse.

**CARE FOR WEAPONS**: (might 2+) You are able to apply a bit of magic when caring for a weapon.
