With both humans and lycanthropes among their distant ancestors, shifters posses just a small portion of their forefathers' shape-shifting abilities. They cannot transform wholly into an animal but can instead shift parts of their body to become animal-like for short periods of time. In 832 YK the Church of the Silver Flame led an inquisition to wipe out all lycanthropes in Khorvaire, Shifters included. The inquisition lasted fifty years killing most lycanthropes and driving the survivors deep into the Eldeen Reaches.

## Starting Ability
SHIFTING TRAITS: choose 2 different traits at creation. 
- gain an edge (*)
- you have 2 advantage in all running tasks (*)
- you have 2 advantage in all jumping tasks (*)
- you have 1 advantage in all perception tasks (*)
- your unarmed attacks deal 1 additional damage (*)
- your unarmed attacks count as medium weapons
- your armor is increased by 1 (*)

Traits marked with a (*) can later be taken multiple times. Each time it is choosen, it counts as a seperate trait. I.E. armor trait taken twice counts as two seperate traits, but the effects stack.

LEAST SHIFT: (might 4) you gain the benefit of 1 of your shifter traits until you use this ability again. Action.

WEAKNESS TO SILVER: when struck by an attack with the silver quality, your Intellect pool is reduced by 1. If you are in your shifted form, your Intellect pool is also reduced by the number of shifter traits you have active.
