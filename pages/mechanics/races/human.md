The dominant race of Eberron, humans are originally from the continent of Sarlona but migrated westward nearly 4,000 years ago arriving in the region now known as The Lhazaar Principalities. Over the next century humans spread across the face of Khorvaire establishing settlements that would later evolve into what are now known as the Five Nations.

Since humans are a relatively young race in Eberron there are no distinct racial subtypes. Natives of the five nations tend toward certain personality stereotypes, but few could pick out a Brelander from a Karnnathi just on sight alone. Some lingering tensions exist between citizens of nations following the Last War, but these hostilities lie only in the nation in which one pledges allegiance to. A Cyran refugee who embraces the Silver Flame and thranish culture would be just as accepted by other citizens of Thrane as a native born.
