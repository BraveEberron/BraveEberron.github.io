When [elves](elf.html) first immigrated to Khorvaire, they found human nations expanding and solidifying their power. Fascinated by these people, many elves attempted to marry into their nobility. The elves anticipated that their longer-lived progeny would eventually supplant the human nobility, but were disappointed with the results. They found their hybrid offspring to possess too many human qualities to be easily controlled, bucking elven traditions.
Eventually the elves acclimated to their new neighbors and, for the most part, kept to themselves. First-generation half-elves occurred less and less frequently. Nowadays, the most frequent half-elven births are bred true from half-elven parents, and these half-elves call themselves Khoravar, meaning "Children of Khorvaire" in the elvish language.
