title: Available Descriptors

From the core book, only the Foolish descriptor is not allowed.

In addition to those featured in the core book, Eberron provides its own set of descriptors in the form of Dragonmarks. It is suggested that you read up on Dragonmarks a bit before taking one as a descriptor since they have restrictions and provide additional options at later tiers.

1. You must choose a dragonmark that is available to your race.  
Some races never manifested dragonmarks to begin with. These races include the Warforged, Shifters, and Changelings.

2. Selecting a dragonmark gives you access to buy powers later.  
Each dragonmark has four stages. When you first take it as a descriptor, you gain the Starter mark. This gives you training in a skill and some bonus points to one of your stat pools. When you are choosing your tier 1 abilities for your type you can choose to take the Least Mark. This gives you the powers listed in the Least Mark section of that mark. Then at tier 3 and tier 5 you can do the same thing with the Lesser and Greater Marks, respectively.

## Marked
You were born with a dragonmark, a sign that you belong to one of the 12 great houses of Eberron. Even if you did not know of your relation to the house, the mark is undeniable proof of your blood. You always have a seat in the house and can always get work from them. You can choose to ignore the house or maybe despise them, but they will always be there and so will the mark.

You gain the characteristics listed under the Mark you choose.  
Additionally, at tier 1 you can choose to take Least Mark as an ability. This grants you the powers listed under the Least Mark section. At tier 3 and tier 5, you can take Lesser and Great Mark abilities.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:
From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.  

1. Your house has sent you out into the world to collect information about other countries or houses. Your mission is one of information.  
2. You are avoiding your house. Maybe because you never wanted to join them or you have angered them and fear the punishment. You think the best way to hide is to get out of town.  
3. You were born with the mark but outside of the house, likely as a bastard child. But you plan to connect with the house once you find them.  
4. Your house has sent you to observe one of your party members.
