# Is an living Artifact
At some point you were given life by extrodinary arcane means. Whether you were born this way (warforged) or died and we're brought back to life, you are powered by an artifact. 

Biological race: Your heart is arcane and you are not undead, but by all means should be. Where your heart should be in a khyber crystal. From the outside you look normal and you require rest and food like anyone else. But you tire less easily, as your heart does not pump like everyone else.

Artifical Race: your arcane connection goes beyond even that of the Psiforged. Your body is covered in Crystal inlays and the center of your chest holds a dimly pulling Khyber Crystal.

## Connection
1. Pick one other PC. Either by accident or in purpose, she is the cause for you needing the arcane heart. You might still hold some resentment or are happy about the change.
2. Pick one other PC. You were once convinced that she wanted to take your arcane heart, but you have since grown to think that what you believed wasn’t true, or at least no longer is so.
3. Pick one other PC. She roused you from a long period of inactivity, and you feel indebted to her for returning you (perhaps accidentally) to mobility.
4. Pick one other PC. If you go berserk, you’ll never attack that character.

## Additional Equipment
You start with a level 3 Crystal Artifact. It has 6 charges. But it does nothing.

Your arcane heart surges in power, giving you an asset to your next physical task.
