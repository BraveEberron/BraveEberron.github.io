At some point, you were given life by extrodinary arcane means. Whether you were born this way or died and we're brought back to life, you are powered by an artifact. 

You are not undead, but by all means should be. A Khyber Crystal replaced your heart and keeps you alive. This new biology also changed your appearance. Your skin appears to be covered in a dimmly glowing tattoo and your eyes leave an almost imperceptable trail as you move.

## Connection
1. Pick one other PC. Either by accident or in purpose, she is the cause for you needing the arcane heart. You might still hold some resentment or are happy about the change.
2. Pick one other PC. You were once convinced that she wanted to take your arcane heart, but you have since grown to think that what you believed wasn’t true, or at least no longer is so.
3. Pick one other PC. She roused you from a long period of inactivity, and you feel indebted to her for returning you (perhaps accidentally) to mobility.
4. Pick one other PC. If you go berserk, you’ll never attack that character.

## Additional Equipment
You start with a level 3 Crystal Artifact. It has 6 charges. But it does nothing.

## Minor Effect Suggestions
Your arcane heart surges in power, giving you an asset to your next physical task.

## Major Effect Suggestions
You unleash a wave of energy that knocks a target prone.
