## Siberys Shard Items
**Dragonmark Focus**. The simplest and most common form of dragonshard items, a dragonshard focus is an amulet holding a small Siberys shard. This shard is attuned to enhance a specific dragonmark. When worn by a person whose mark matches the stone, the wearer gains a free focus to increase the power of the rituals they perform with the mark.

Price. +1 effort 2,000. +2 effort 4,000. +3 effort 8,000. +4 effort 16,000.

**Dragonshard Reservoir**. Each ring has a rating of Least, Lesser, or Greater. A dragonshard reservoir can store and produce the magical ability required to power a dragonmark ritual. Each day, this object produces 1 point. The reservoir can store 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the rating of the ring. You can spend the points from the ring in place of some or all of the karma to activate a ritual of the similar rating.

A character must wear the ring for 24 hours before it starts to create charges and it will stop producing if another Dragonshard reservoir of the same rating is attuned to the character.

Price. Least 4,000. Lesser 16,000. Greater 32,000.
