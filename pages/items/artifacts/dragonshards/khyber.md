## Artifact Rules
- no depletion roll
- elemental effects
- bound elemental level dependent

Eberron shards are plentiful but tend to not hold a charge very well. After several uses, an artifact powered by an Eberron shard will cease to function. What they lack in longevity they made up for in usability. They have a remarkable ability to duplicate the effects of a spell that they are attuned to.

## Example Artifacts
These shards are primarily used for binding, so it is rare to find artificers using them for anything else.
