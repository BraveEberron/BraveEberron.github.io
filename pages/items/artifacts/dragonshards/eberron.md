## Artifact Rules
- depletion roll each use
- generalized effects
- level dependent

Eberron shards are plentiful but tend to not hold a charge very well. After several uses, an artifact powered by an Eberron shard will cease to function. What they lack in longevity they made up for in usability. They have a remarkable ability to duplicate the effects of a spell that they are attuned to.

> This setting is using modified depletion rolls for artifacts. When a depletion roll is called for, you roll a 1d6. On a result of a 1, the artifact losses one charge. When no charges are left, the artifact become innert. These charges can be restored by powerful artificers, but not many are in the business of recharging.

Artifact Level|Max Charges|
---|---|---
1|30|
2|27|
3|24|
4|21|
5|18|
6|15|
7|12|
8|9|
9|6|
10+|3|

### Common Terms
**Dimming**: After each use of the artifact, the effective level of the artifact is reduced by one. The level resets after you take a 10 hour rest.

**Recharge**: After the artifact is used, it will cease to function until time has passed.

**Effective Level of the Artifact (eloa)**: When an artifact uses the level of the artifact for its effect, use the effective level. Certain abilities increase or decrease this.

**Enabler**: The artifact's ability can be activated without taking significant action.

**Action**: The artifact's ability requires an action to activate.

**Reaction**: The artifact's ability can be activated almost automatically, even during another creatures turn.
