## Artifact Rules
- depletion roll each use
- generalized effects
- level dependent

Eberron shards are plentiful but tend to not hold a charge very well. After several uses, an artifact powered by an Eberron shard will cease to function. What they lack in longevity they made up for in usability. They have a remarkable ability to duplicate the effects of a spell that they are attuned to.

> This setting is using modified depletion rolls for artifacts. When a depletion roll is called for, you roll a 1d6. On a result of a 1, the artifact losses one charge. When no charges are left, the artifact become innert. These charges can be restored by powerful artificers, but not many are in the business of recharging.

Artifact Level|Max Charges|

1|30|
2|27|
3|24|
4|21|
5|18|
6|15|
7|12|
8|9|
9|6|

## Example Artifacts

### Ring of Counter Spell
**PREPARE COUNTER** (1 karma). You perform a small ritual and choose a spell aspect (Examples: fire, cold, electricty, teleport, darkness, light, force). This ritual takes 1 minute to perform.  
**COUNTER**. When you are the target of a spell with the same aspect stored in the ring and the source of the spell is less than the eloa, your ring unleashes the power you stored in your ring to counter the trigger spell. The spell that targets you has no effect on you. If the spell hits multiple targets, only you are not effected. The activation takes no action, but cannot be done again until you prepare another counter. Enabler.

> Depletion roll after each use of Counter.

3 | 200
4 | 500
5 | 1,000

8 | 5,000

### Everbright Lantern
An everbright lantern combines the effect of a continual flame spell with an Eberron shard attuned to that spell. This bright light is mounted inside a normal bullseye lantern, allowing the light to be shuttered off. An everbright lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone, just like a mundane bullseye lantern, but its flame never goes out.

> Depletion roll after each night of use.

### Scrying Shard
A large Eberron shard attuned to the scrying spell can serve as a portable focus for that spell.
SCRY (1 karma) Those with the ability to perform scry, or any similar spell, can use the artifact as the viewing glass to gain an asset to prevent detection or using the level of the artifact instead. For those without the ritual, they can perform the ritual and use the artifact's level -2 to prevent detection.

Depletion. Each use of the artifact for scrying.
