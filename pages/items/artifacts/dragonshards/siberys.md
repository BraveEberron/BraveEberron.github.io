## Artifact Rules
- no depletion roll
- enhance dragonmarks
- non-level dependant

Artifacts made of Siberys shards are unique since they do not run out of arcane energy like Eberron shards. They have been found to enhance the abilities of a dragonmark but are unable to do much on their own. As a result, the effect tends to not be effected by the level of the artifact.

## Example Artifacts

### Dragonmark Focus
The simplest and most common form of dragonshard items, a dragonshard focus is an amulet holding a small Siberys shard. This shard is attuned to enhance a specific dragonmark. When worn by a person whose mark matches the stone, the wearer gains a free effort to increase the power of the rituals they perform with the mark.

Effort | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
 +1 | 2 | 2,000
 +2 | 4 | 4,000
 +3 | 6 | 8,000
 +4 | 8 | 16,000

### Dragonshard Reservoir
Each ring has a rating of Least, Lesser, or Greater. A dragonshard reservoir can store and produce the magical ability required to power a dragonmark ritual. Each day, this object produces 1 point. The reservoir can store 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the rating of the ring. You can spend the points from the ring in place of some or all of the karma to activate a ritual of the similar rating.

A character must wear the ring for 24 hours before it starts to create charges and it will stop producing if another Dragonshard reservoir of the same rating is attuned to the character.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
 Least | 2 | 2,000
 Lesser | 5 | 16,000
 Greater | 8 | 32,000

### Keycharm
While they are almost trivially simple to produce, these charms are critically important to the warding services of House Kundarak. When a character uses the Mark of Warding to cast alarm, arcane lock, explosive runes, or any similar spell ritual, she can invest ownership of the spell into a keycharm. Whoever holds the charm is considered to be the caster of the spell for purposes of bypassing its effects (or receiving the mental alert from an alarm). The charm has no inherent powers, and if the spell it is linked to expires, it is considered to be a mundane object — although a dragonmarked character could link it to a new warding spell.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
 Least | 2 | 150
 Lesser | 5 | 250
 Greater | 8 | 500

### Prospector's Rod
This short rod of cold iron is the key to House Tharashk’s mining operations. A prospector’s rod amplifies the ability of the Mark of Finding. If the wielder performs a finding ritual while holding the rod, he gains the following benefits.

- duration is extended for as long as he concentrates on the desired object.
- the user can specify a quantity of material to search for: "three or more pounds of byeshk," "one hundred gallons of water," and so on.
- the range doubles or increases to 1000 feet, which ever is better.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
 Least | 4 | 7,500
 Lesser | 6 | 10,000
 Greater | 8 | 20,000

### Wheel of Wind and Water
This ornately carved wooden wheel resembles the helm of a mundane sailing ship, but it is mounted at the helm of an elemental galleon or a House Lyrandar airship. By gripping the wheel, a character with the wind’s favor ability of the lesser Mark of Storm can telepathically control the elemental bound into the vessel, forcing it to move the vessel as the dragonmark heir desires.

If a wheel of wind and water is mounted on a mundane sailing ship, a character with the lesser Mark of Storm can perform a lesser ritual to create an area of ideal conditions around the vessel, enabling it to sail at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
Least | 4 | 8,000

### Speaking Stone
This device is the key to long-distance communications across Khorvaire, powering the message stations of House Sivis. A character who possesses the least Mark of Scribing canperform a least ritual to use a speaking stone to send a message to any other speaking stone; the sender must know the location of the target stone. The message travels at a rate of 1 mile per minute and has no maximum range or length.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for any messages that may come in and scribing them upon receipt. Large cities, such as Sharn, may contain multiple stone stations. Major stations often possess more than one speaking stone.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
Least | 3 | 10,000

### Astral Beacon
Tied to the Mark of Passage, this object acts as a magical beacon to Orien heirs slipping through the Astral Plane. A character using the dimension door ritual of the lesser Mark of Passage always counts as having a door within 10 feet of the beacon as being tagged. 

Greater Beacons also allow the teleport ritual to travel twice as far if the end destination is within 10 feet of the beacon. In addition, a location within 10 feet of an astral beacon is always treated as “very familiar” to a character with the teleport ritual, for purposes of determining whether she arrives on target. 

An astral beacon is an 8-inch sphere formed from silver and crystal, with the dragonshard at the core; it is often encased in lead or embedded in the floor of a chamber to prevent enemies from stealing or smashing the sphere.

Mark | Level | Cost
---------|----------|---------
Least | 4 | 30,000
Greater | 8 | 40,000
