Dragonshards are translucent stones with pulsating veins of color within them. They can be found in various parts of Eberron, and come in three distinct varieties, varying in color, location, and uses. Dragonshards are used to enhance the powers of a Dragonmark, or in the creation of magic items, artifacts, or constructs. Dragonshards are important to many of the magic technologies used throughout the Five Nations.

## Siberys Dragonshards
Siberys dragonshards are golden in color and fall from the Ring of Siberys, which means they are usually found on the surface in equatorial regions of Eberron. Siberys dragonshards are the rarest of the three varieties, and are sold in quantities only in Stormreach on the continent of Xen'Drik, or in Sharn on Khorvaire. Siberys dragonshards are most closely linked with Dragonmarks and are often used to enhance Dragonmark abilities. It is rumored that each Siberys dragonshard has in it a dragonmark pattern, but the shard has to be cut just right for it to be seen.

## Khyber Dragonshards
Khyber dragonshards are generally a dark blue or black and can be found beneath the surface of Eberron in deep underground caverns. While, Siberys dragonshards are the hardest to find, Khyber dragonshards are the most dangerous to obtain of because of the denizens lurking in Khyber. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding, and are most notable for their use in crafting bound-elemental items, such as the Lightning Rail.

## Eberron Dragonshards
Eberron dragonshards, also known as bloodstones, are typically pink in color and can be found within egg-shaped stones buried beneath top-soil, or the watery muck in swampy regions. Eberron dragonshards are the most common of the three varieties, especially on the continent of Khorvaire. Like other dragonshards, they are used in the creation of magic items, but have a broader spectrum of uses than the other types of dragonshards.
