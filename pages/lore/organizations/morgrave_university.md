Morgrave University is not the most reputable institution in Khorvaire. It lacks the resources of the Library of Korranberg or Wynarn University, and many claim that its archaeological activities are infested with smugglers and treasure hunters. While the university lacks the clout of its peers in Korranberg and Aundair, it is much more accessible to young adventurers who have yet to build a reputation.

In the past, most nobles were educated in the colleges of Zilargo or Aundair. When Lord Larethir’Morgrave established his university in the city of Sharn two hundred sixty years ago, he claimed it would be “a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city, illuminating the forgotten secrets of the past.” While many city elders applauded Morgrave’s work, he had his enemies. Morgrave was said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some claimed that the true purpose of the university was to assist him in his treasure hunting. Suspicions aside, Sharn’s proximity to Xen’drik has made Morgrave University a nexus for scholars wishing to study the secret continent.

The Master of Morgrave University is the oldest heir of the Morgrave line. Currently the university head is Larrianir’Morgrave, a scholar who has spent decades studying the civilizations of ancient Xen’drik.
