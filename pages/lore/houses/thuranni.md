House Thuranni is an elven dragonmarked house which was once a part of House Phiarlan and has become their direct rivals competing in entertainment and espionage. House Thuranni is the youngest of the dragonmarked houses and lives a double life, to the public they are artists, entertainers and beautiful courtiers however, that is far from the truth. House Phiarlan is still larger and stronger than House Thuranni, leading the way in information gathering and spying however, there is one field that House Thuranni surpasses their cousins, assassinations.

## History
During the early years of the Last War House Thuranni's members were still apart of House Phiarlan and carried out many assassination contracts. The Thuranni family were mainly based in north-western Khorvaire and much of it's work was performed in Karrnath. It worked closely with the Emerald Claw during these years. House Phiarlan was contracted to assassinate the rivals of Galifar heirs and would-be usurpers, however it was the intelligence gathering which put the house under intense pressure as these requests came from all nations and factions. Due to the sheer volume of these contracts many of the dragonmarked elves families found themselves working at cross-purposes and directly competing with each other. Many lost their neutrality and developed loyalty to particular clients and nations. In 972 YK Thuranni family assassins turned on another House Phiarlan family, the Paelion family. Few members of the Paelion family survived the attempted extermination and those who did went into hiding. The leader of the House Phiarlan, Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan condemned the actions of the Thuranni family and called for the excoriation of them, however Elar Thuranni refused the judgement and declared his family as a new house. The debate as to whether Thuranni would become a new house was fierce and lasted for years, however the Twelve eventually agreed in favour of Thuranni.

## Business
House Thuranni competes with House Phiarlan in the entertainment, information brokering, assassination and espionage businesses, however it is only in assassinations that Thuranni manages to surpass its rival. Not even the elite can simply hire a Thurannni assassin as only Thuranni chooses its clients. It is rumoured that House Thuranni works with the Emerald Claw. House Thuranni offers its services as artists and courtiers to the public. Secret services such as Aundair's Royal Eyes often rely on the information purchased from House Thuranni and Phiarlan. House Thuranni has more artisans than actual artists from architects to painters and sculptors, however there are still many actors, dancers and musicians within the house.
