House Phiarlan is an elven dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire, although they are now based in Sharn, Breland their former base of operation in Cyre having been destroyed in the Day of Mourning. To the public Phiarlan is a house of entertainment comprised of bards, actors, artists and acrobats though, in secret it is a house of spies.

> "We are the shadow- the border between light and darkness. We are not simply spies or assassins. We are agents of balance, and through our dance, we shape the future". -Kaleth Shol d'Phiarlan, ghost of the Serpentine Table.

## Dragonmark
House Phiarlan possesses the Mark of Shadow. The oldest living dragonmark the Mark of Shadow first appeared on Aerenal. This mark grants various magical benefits that relate to divination and illusions. The house turned this power to the arts of entertainment as well as the skills of actors, musicians, and acrobats.

## History
During the Last War which began in 894 YK, House Phiarlan offered its services of spying and intelligence to all nations, refusing to side with anyone. Due to House Phiarlan's secrecy and to the fact that they were taking contracts from all sides, eventually House Phiarlan agents found themselves contracted against each other which led to conflicting loyalties. The result was a cataclysmic event for Phiarlan named the Shadow Schism which tore the House apart and led to the creation of Phiarlan's rivals, House Thuranni who themselves, are former members of Phiarlan.

## Performances
The members of Phiarlan have held on strong to traditions. They believe that their greatest treasures of the house are the works of ancient artists. The great works that the house has can normally only be performed by a single person. These heirlooms are handed down by the person who has possesses the heirloom, giving it to another worthy individual.

## Joining House Phiarlan
In the past, marrying into House Phiarlan was a rare event that'd never occur more than twice in a century however, the shadow schism greatly reduced its membership and bloodline's diversity. Though the House still only accepts elves, it now allows those outside of the dragonmarked families to join. For a candidate to even be considered they must have exceptional artistic talent or equal skill in stealth and subterfuge.
