House Vadalis is a human dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire though their main operation is centered in the Eldeen Reaches having migrated there almost 2,000 years ago. The house's most significant trade is in the breeding and training of animals.

## Dragonmark
House Vadalis possesses the Mark of Handling. This mark grants various magical benefits related to calming and controlling animals. Vadalis has turned this into a booming trade in magebred animals. Everything from mounts, to guards to pets can be bought from Vadalis stables. In addition to its animal husbandry Vadalis stables are among the best in Khorvaire, and the house also provides lines of communication to outposts too small to feature a House Sivis enclave.
