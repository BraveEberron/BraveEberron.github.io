House Orien is a human dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire, with its major enclave located in Passage, Aundair, the house specialises in courier services and land based transport. Though House Cannith invented the lightning rail, House Orien are the ones who operate and manage it.

## Dragonmark
House Orien possesses the Mark of Passage. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to control travel and teleportation.

## History
The war adversely effected House Orien as bridges and rail tracks were often destroyed in order to slow down enemy advancements. To make matters worse, House Lyrandar began running the airship business toward the end of the war. House Orien's dominance over the field of transportation has never been so unsure, in an effort to regain control the house has begun to focus on its teleportation business, though teleportation remains expensive.

## Business
House Orien has a large stake in the transportation business and a dominance over the postal business. It seperates these two businesses into two guilds, the couriers guild and the transportation guild. The couriers guild hires independant messengers and couriers to deliver letters and small parcels. Whilst the transportation guild prepares goods for shipment, running the lightning rail and maintaining the trade roads. The transportation guild is the largest dragonmarked guild and has tens of thousands of employees. It is rare for one to hire a Orien caravan to travel to a location of their choice as the price is often too steep. It is far more common to find travellers paying a fee in order to accompany a caravan along its pre-set route throughout a city or to a nearby settlement though, Orien often waves the fare for adventurers so long as they offer their services to protect the caravan. The house also runs a teleportation business though, due to its high fees it has yet to become a mainstream form of transportation.

## Joining House Orien
House Orien is a cosmopolitan organization and has by far the most diverse membership. Though it is a human dragonmarked house, many half-elves and half-orcs are members and even a few elves, dopplegangers and shifters have married into the line. House Orien encourages its heirs to have numerous children even accepting those born out of wedlock as fully-fledged scions to the house, a practice that is rare for a dragonmarked house. Though non-humans within the house have no dragonmark to pass onto their offspring, they and their children have a home and future within the house. House Orien prefers that its members focus on skills and talents useful in day to day labor, or ones that enhance the powers granted by their dragonmarks. To that end members of Orien often become artificers, bards, fighters, magewrights or wizards.
