> "It is as though the world dare not draw breath for fear that delicate balance should shift and fall, and a new Day of Mourning fall upon us". - Jarlen d'Cannith, House Cannith Chronicler and Lord Seneschal. 

## Dragonmark
House Cannith possesses the Mark of Making. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to infuse items with magic or even repair them, giving Cannith an advantage in the manufacturing arena.

## History
When the Last War broke out Cannith was ready to reap the benefits and found itself acting as an arms dealer to all nations. They managed to amass a great fortune of wealth that was is only outdone by House Kundarak. They also gained something more valuable than money: political power. The Five Nations became so reliant on Cannith weapons to the point House Cannith was able to influence their decisions thus becoming the most politically powerful Dragonmarked House.

Simply selling weapons and armour was about to end when the first warforged soldiers marched out of Cannith's forgehold in 965 YK at Whitehearth and Cannith then began supplying not only weapons but the soldiers that wielded them. House Cannith was believed to be the most powerful Dragonmarked House but on the Day of Mourning they were dealt a severe blow that cost them greatly. On that same day they didn't just lose the Whitehearth forgehold and its wealth, knowledge, resources and inhabitants but their leader Baron Starrin d'Cannith and many of the House's heirs.

With the end of the war matters only got worse for Cannith as the Treaty of Thronehold not only set free all Warforged but also banned Cannith from creating any more. With the end of the war came the end of Cannith's role as mass arms dealer and some of their political influence ended with it.

The leaders of House Cannith today have become incredibly determined to restore their power and wealth leading to bitter rivalry amongst the leaders. At every given moment the inventors of House Cannith are directed to work in secret laboratories, restlessly working to out do their past creations and create Eberron's next technological revolution.

## Hierarchy
The ruling leader of House Cannith is called a Patriarch or Matriarch for female leaders. The last Patriarch was Starrin d'Cannith. After the Day of Mourning a new patriarch was to be assigned however, with Starrin's only heir dead the decision became incredibly complicated. Three heirs stepped up to claim the title and now each of them have divided House Cannith into Cannith West, East and South. The three heirs are Merrix, Zorlan and Jorlana.

## Business
House Cannith produce mundane fine wares that although were crafted using magic, are not magical items. Items that are created by House Cannith are marked with the House's gorgon symbol, a symbol which is known to indicate quality and value. Cannith create all sorts of items such as watertight barrels, horse shoes and sword hilts. Cannith's fabricators guild operate a few retail establishments however, Cannith prefers to leave the selling to merchants so they can focus on production, infact Cannith dominate commerce and industry in Khorvaire. Cannith's Tinkers Guild enlist roaming Tinkers that provide a repair service for broken goods. Cannith magewrights are also needed for the production of various elemental machines.
