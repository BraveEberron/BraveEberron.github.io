House Lyrandar is a half-elven dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire with its enclave located on Stormhome an island city-state just north of Aundair.
As is common among other dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar is led by a baron (patriarch or matriarch). Some in the house refer to the baron as "Firstborn", believing that Lyran and Selavash, the ancient ancestors of House Lyrandar and the spiritual ancestors of the Khoravar race, speak through that individual.

## Dragonmark
House Lyrandar possesses the Mark of Storm. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to control winds and waves.

## History
Unlike some houses, such as Orien and Cannith, who suffered huge losses during the war, Lyrandar completed the war without incurring much loss. And unlike some houses, like Jorasco, Lyrandar's has not suffered much in the way of political backlash for the money they made during the war.

Instead, the nations they served largely credit them with providing weather for crops and preventing droughts, and their airships for giving the post-war economic boost necessary for the five nations to rebuild. Lyrandar's status is now arguably higher than it has ever been, and the future looks bright.

Their relations with certain other dragonmarked houses is not as rosy. Orien, their main competitor, still reeling from the devastation they suffered during the war, and particularly on the Day of Mourning, when they lost thousands of miles of lightning rail lines and the enormous transfer hub at Metrol, are increasingly angered by Lyrandar's encroachment onto what they view as their territory. House Cannith, who provided the initial design work for the airships, feels that it deserves greater compensation and wants a percentage for all airships sold. But while Lyrandar negotiates with these houses, their power and prestige continue to grow with the general populace.

## Joining House Lyrandar
House Lyrandar is perceived to be a haven for the Khoravar and its viceroys actively encourages them to join the house's guilds. Khoravar who show exceptional skill can be adopted into the house. It is absolutely essential to be Khoravar to join House Lyrandar whether through a blood-line, marriage or adoption. Lyrandar are quite lenient when it comes to the joining their guilds as all races are welcome though, they face discrimination as they are excluded from ever holding high office. Lyrandar heirs are strongly discouraged from marrying outside the Khoravar race, doing so was formerly a crime, the punishment being excoriation. Low ranking members of Lyrandar are often aristocrats, experts and magewrights. While the more higher ranked members are more likely to be bards, rogues or swashbucklers or wizards. Alternatively members of the Rain Callers and Sela's Path are more likely to be clerics, adepts or druids. Over the course of the last century, a number of heirs have become artificers, seeking to reduce Lyrandar's dependence on House Cannith's ability to bind elementals to their vessels.
