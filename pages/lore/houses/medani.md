House Medani is a half-elven dragonmarked house and is known as the smallest and one of the youngest houses. However, despite its size and age, its members are seemingly everywhere, working as operatives in various fields such as guards, researchers, advisers, inquisitives and spy-catchers. Unlike most dragonmarked houses, Medani has a strong geographical location as the majority of its members are Brelish nationals and live in Breland.

> "Let the other houses bluster and call us 'upstart.' When they realise we hold the keys that can release the secrets of the Five Nations, they will learn respect." -Baron Trelib d'Medani, patriarch of House Medani.

## Dragonmark
House Medani possesses the Mark of Detection. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to detect threats making Medani sentries an invaluable asset to nobles and royal families across Khorvaire.

## History
The rumors of Medani having allegiance to Breland over the other houses became evermore solid during the Last War as Medani worked for the crown as a counter-intelligence arm, discovering and apprehending spies and assassins from rival nations. Despite its blatant preference towards Breland, Medani never went as far as to directly supply infiltration services however, due to the war there was a shortage of law enforcers in the country, so Medani participated in a lot of criminal investigations. The connection between Medani and Breland remains to the present day and now the house has a subtle yet broad influence over the ruling of the nation.

## Business
Like all dragonmarked Medani trades with the nations of Khorvaire however, they favour trade with Breland so much to the point they have directly supplied operatives to work within King Boranel's court. House Medani has been charged with uncovering the murder of Bornanel's first wife Queen Chaseva.

The Warning Guild provides bodyguards, inquisitives and sentries for hire all across Khorvaire. Despite taking part in the guarding business, there is little conflict between Deneith and Medani as Medani's fewer numbers of members causes little competition. A common belief when hiring bodyguards is that you hire Deneith when you expect to get attacked and hire Medani guards when you believe someone is plotting against you though you're unsure who it is or their motive.

The Basilisk's Gaze guild hunts war criminals wanted by the five nations. Despite its reclusive nature towards the other dragonmarked houses, Medani is an active member of the Twelve.

## Joining House Medani
Medani only allow elves, half-elves and humans to join the official ranks of the house, not even through marriage can a member of another race join. In order to strengthen the half-elf bloodline with their ancestors, the house elders encourage intermarriage with elves and humans. Marriage with other races is banned and generally shunned.

Hirelings can be from any race though, they can never climb in rank despite their contributions. Hirelings can join the Warning guild providing they have the skills necessary. Those who join will be given certification and are able to work under the banner of Medani however, hirelings who excel at their duties can officially work as apart of the house, this is more easily achieved in Sharn and Wroat.
