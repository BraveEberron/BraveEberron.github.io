House Ghallanda is a halfling dragonmarked house found throughout Khorvaire. Ghallanda is one of the few Dragonmarked Houses that are not involved with some form of arms dealing or soldiering, instead Ghallanda are Eberron's best hosts dealing in food and shelter.

## Dragonmark
House Ghallanda bears the Mark of Hospitality. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers control over food and shelter, giving Ghallanda an advantage in all areas related to hospitality.

## History
House Deneith and House Ghallanda agreed on a contingent during the early years of The Last War for Ghallanda members to follow Deneith soldiers to provide them food and shelter on the field. It wasn't long until the nations' noticed the effectiveness of House Ghallanda and began hiring them to provide the same treatment for their armies. House Ghallanda wished to avoid taking sides and to remain a non-combatant however, when things went wrong they found themselves fighting alongside soldiers on the front lines. These soldiers now turned veteran are still around to this day and are not completely uncommon.

## Business
House Ghallanda offer their customers to spend time at their enclaves, much like a hotel. Under the signing of the Treat of Thronehold Ghallanda secured concessions freeing their enclaves from the local law, effectively turning them into individual nations. Ghallanda holds no quarrel with their customers, so long as they pay. Anyone who is wanted can escape the law by visitng a Ghallanda enclave. 

House Ghallanda also runs taverns and inns throughout Khorvaire, all of which hold the Mark of Hospitality. Ghallanda also can contribute to war efforts supplying soldiers with magically created food and shelter.
