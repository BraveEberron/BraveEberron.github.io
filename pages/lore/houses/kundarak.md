House Kundarak is a Dwarven house with services focused in security and banking. Their primary customers are those who have enough coin to buy something worth protecting including the wealthy, the powerful, other dragon marked houses and even state governments. They are the wealthiest Dragonmarked House by far and their banking establishments can be found all over Khorvaire. 

## Dragonmark
House Kundarak possesses the Mark of Warding which allows the bearers to secure items, papers and money giving reason to why they are the number one service in security.

## History
House Kundarak played an essential part during the Last War but preferred to take a financial role rather than a direct military presence which gave way to Kundarak becoming the banking establishment it is to date. Largely part to a financial infusion between House Kundarak and the Mror Hold's, twenty years into the war the Mror Holds declared its independence.

When years of war became decades the nations of Khorvaire quickly became heavily indebted to House Kundarak relying on large loans to pay for equipment and provisions. At the end of the war all nations owed Kundarak a large sum and to make sure they all pay their debts Kundarak demanded that an order be placed in the Treaty of Thronehold demanding the nations to settle them.

Like all other Dragonmarked Houses, House Kundarak provides services as a business. It's traditional business is banking which involves loans and storage. Another service is security, for paying clients Kundarak will build and install security. Similar to their banking business they offer to store any item in their highly secured vaults.

**Golden Door**: This is actually a division of the Warding Guild rather than a independent guild itself. Golden Door is responsible for the development and installment of advanced security systems such as complex locks and magical wards. The majority of its contracts are internal, focusing on the security of house Kundarak before all else though the house extends its services to other dragonmarked houses and the rich.

**Iron Gate**: Another division of the Warding Guild, Iron Gate provides guards who've received training in guarding objects and places of importance. Acting like a secret service the members of Iron Gate are highly elusive and are rarely seen beyond their designated posts. Iron Gate extend their services to the guarding of personnel though they avoid clashing with House Deneith's Defenders guild. Despite this the majority of the political class of the Mror Holds are often protected by Iron Gate guards.
