House Tharashk is a human and half-orc dragonmarked house that has just recently begun spreading throughout Khorvaire, though it is still heavily based in The Shadow Marches. The house is the second youngest. Its members are renowned prospectors, bounty hunters and inquisitives. Tharashk is the only house to hire monstrous laborers and mercenaries from Droaam, a nation they have an alliance with.

## Dragonmark
House Tharashk possesses the Mark of Finding. This mark grants various magical benefits related to locating people and objects which in turn has led to their fame for bounty hunting. 

## History
When the Last War began Tharashk had little interest and intervention and the war was the same in return. The war had no effect on Tharashk's trade as it occurred in the wilds and Shadow Marches. The only times Tharashk was called upon was for search and rescue missions which felt more like a charity than business.

The war finally came to Tharashk in its later stage though not in anyway they'd expect. The war led to the rise of Droaam as a nation and House Tharashk took advantage of this by negotiating trade deals and eventually an alliance.  

## Tharashk Clans
Unlike other dragonmarked houses Tharashk's clans are incredibly important and they are not as united. It is uncommon for a Tharashk house member to refer to themselves as d'Tharashk and the use of their clan name is more prominent. The three main clans are Aashta, Torrn and Velderan though these aren't the only clans that make up Tharashk, smaller clans tend to be aligned with one of them. Although the clans do their best to work together for the sake of the house, heirs often put the interests of their clan before the house which has led to many feuds. 

## Business
House Tharashk act as a proxy business for the Sisters of Sora Kell by negotiating trade with the rest of Khorvaire for them. Anyone wanting to contract the monster labourers or mercenaries of Droaam go through Tharashk in order to do so. House Deneith are in direct competition with Tharashk as they wish to wrestle the monster mercenaries out of their control. Though neither house admits to open conflict between each other, sabotage and secret operations occur often. House Tharashk makes a large amount of profit through prospecting and the sale of dragonshards. Additionally, many House Tharashk heirs become professional inquisitives and can be hired.

### Droaam Contracts
House Tharashk contracts monster races from Droaam to either be mercenaries or laborers. Contracted monsters are first evaluated to make sure they are able to communicate and be non violent towards other humanoids. They are then licensed and monitored by the Dragonne's Roar. Gnolls, ogres and minotaurs are fielded as mercenaries or laborers, while gargoyles and harpies are used as couriers, scouts and messengers. As a rule, House Tharashk only contracts monsters to clients with good credentials such as dragonmarked heirs. Mercenaries are more expensive than laborers as laborers will only fight when their own life is threatened. Services are restricted to one location such as a city, contracted monsters cannot be taken on journeys. The house makes profit through volume so monsters are often contracted in groups larger than twenty and for at least a month's work paid in advance.
