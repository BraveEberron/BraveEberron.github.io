In the mythic past the world was one. Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber, the first and greatest of dragonkind, ruled over this mystical unity of all things. In their interrelationship these progenitor wyrms discovered or created the Prophecy, and its words brought reality into being.

Siberys danced through the void, one legend says, setting the stars in their places. Khyber prowled behind, consuming stars nearly as fast as Siberys could scatter them. Eberron sang, apart from the others, and life began to blossom in the void.

Finally, Siberys turned to confront Khyber, to stop the dark dragon from consuming the stars. The two dragons fought, tearing at each other in their hatred. At last Khyber emerged victorious: Siberys was torn asunder, her body broken into numberless fragments. Then, thirsty for blood, Khyber wheeled upon Ebcrron.

When Khyber lunged, Eberron snaked aside. The bloodless battle, a fierce dance, continued for eons, neither dragon gaining ascendancy over the other. At last, Khyber grew tired, and Eberron enfolded and imprisoned Khyber in her own body. The struggles of the progenitor wyrms came at last to an end.

Both dragons slumbered after their long warring and hardened into earth. And so the world was born. Eberron forming its surface and Khyber its dark depths. The fragments of Siberys's broken body encircle Eberron in a great ring that shines in the night.
