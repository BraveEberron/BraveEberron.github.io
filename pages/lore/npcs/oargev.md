Oargev ir’Wynarn is the last son of Cyre‘s ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to Breland when the mysterious disaster of the Mourning befell his nation, after which he became the unofficial leader of the Cyran refugees scattered throughout the other domains. 

He hopes to one day gather all of Cyre’s homeless children to this refuge in Breland: New Cyre. Oargev’s other ambition revolves around discovering the truth behind the destruction of his kin and country, and exacting revenge on the guilty parties. Until then, he graciously accepts the hospitality of Breland (even if the Brelish gave him unwanted land in the middle of nowhere) and works to rebuild the confidence and honor of his subjects. He serves as mayor of New Cyre while also playing the role of a king in exile.

> Weep, oh nations of Khorvaire, for the Jewel of Galifar is no more. You have finally completed what you started when you rejected the true and proper right of Mishann to ascend the throne of Galifar. With your jealousy and petty ambitions, you have brought this disaster on us all!  
Weep, my brothers and sisters, for our homes and our families have been eliminated in a foul and cowardly way. Do not let Cyre be forgotten! Do not let the Day of Mourning end! Not until we have discovered the villain. Not until we have made the villain face justice for this heinous crime. Not until Cyre’s children are once more safe and content within their homeland.  
Weep this day, my fellow Cyrans, and never forget. But tomorrow…tomorrow we begin to hunt down this villain, to demand justice, and to rebuild beloved, cherished Cyre. Tomorrow! Tomorrow we shall go home!
