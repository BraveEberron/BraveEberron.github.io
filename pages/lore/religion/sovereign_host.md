Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals and they are divided across a wide variety of churches and organizations across Eberron. There is no central hierarchy to worship of the various gods of the Sovereign Host and practices vary tremendously between sects.

The Sovereign Host is composed of nine gods but they formerly numbered thirteen before the casting out of four members of the Dark Six. The Traveler and the Shadow are not members of the Sovereign Host. The Shadow being the literal shadow of Aureon while the Traveler seems to have come from someplace else.

The Sovereign Host does not have an afterlife that promises paradise to followers. Instead, it is believed that all souls go to Dolurrh the Plane of the Dead regardless of their virtue in life. A heresy of the Sovereign Host suggests that the plane will eventually be touched by their presence and it will become a paradise that the dead can enjoy. Worshipers do not give offering to the Host for a pleasant afterlife but instead for material gain in this life.

the Sovereign Host is a great deal more tolerant of other religions than the militant followers of the Silver Flame. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host believe that all other deities are (mis)interpretations or corruptions of members of the Host or the Dark Six. In spite of this, certain militant sects like those of Dol Arrah or Dol Dorn have no problem with forced conversion.

Another heresy of the Sovereign Host depicts them as Dragons rather than people. This view is widely loathed by the average Vassal of the Host, however in Argonessen there are some evidence suggesting that the Sovereign Host were originally founded on powerful dragons at the dawn of civilization.

## Arawai

The Sovereign of Law and Lore, Aureon is the patron of wizards and a figure venerated by scholars and librarians. He is the god of magic as a tool for mortals to use. Although all members of the Host are considered equal it is typically written that the Host follows Aureon's guidance due to his vast wisdom.

Long ago, Aureon bound all the evil in his soul and banished it from his personage. This monster became known as the Shadow. It is said that Eberron will come to an end when he and his shadow rejoin. Aureon is the brother of Onatar and the husband of Boldrei. Aureon is portrayed as a gnome or human wizard and occasionally as a blue dragon.

## Balinor

The Sovereign of Horn and Hunt, Balinor embodies the hunt and nature amongst the gods of the Sovereign Host. Revered by rangers, druids and barbarians alike Balinor represents the embodiment of nature, and taking what is needed from the bounty of nature.

The brother of Arawai and the Devourer Balinor is usually portrayed as a burly human although occasionaly he is drawn as a crude but good natured half-orc and even more uncommon, a stalking green dragon.

## Boldrei

The Sovereign of Hall and Hearth, Boldrei is the goddess of hearth and home standing watch over the individual homes, as well as the community at large. When the savage wild presses against the safety of community Boldrei is there to protect it. Together with Aureon they form the core of the typical Vassals worship since most of their daily life revolves around the home and knowledge.

The wife of Aureon, Boldrei is typically portrayed as a commoner of any race or a copper dragon protectively brooding over a nest of eggs.

## Dol Arrah

The Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice, Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but also of the good aspects of a mortals soul. Many Vassals see her as important as Aureon and Boldrei in the formation of a community, and believe that if more of their number recognized that their faith would be much brighter. The patron of paladins, diplomats and all who seek justice as well as explorers who bring light to dark and forgotten places Dol Arrah oversees all those who fight with wisdom as well as weapons. She also provides the light needed for Arawai's harvest.

Often portrayed as a human or half-elf knight shining with holy radiance and occasionally as a red dragon perched atop a cloud Dol Arrah is the sister of Dol Dorn and the Mockery.

## Dol Dorn

The Sovereign of Strength and Steel Dol Dorn is the only chaotic deity of the Sovereign Host and embodies the conflict of good over evil. The patron of any who fight for a living such as fighters, gladiators, or athletes Dol Dorn leads the rest of the Sovereign Host into battle. It was he, it is written, who purged the Dark Six from amongst their ranks long long ago. Dol Dorn despises those who would shed blood for greed or power, but blesses those forced into combat by the hands of a despotic ruler honoring their sense of duty.

Often depicted as a heavily muscled human, dwarf, or half-orc and occasionally as a powerful silver dragon Dol Dorn is the brother of Dol Arrah and the Mockery.

## Kol Korran

The Sovereign of World and Wealth, Kol Korran is the only second generation member of the Sovereign Host; which is fitting since trade and commerce only come into play once the other elements of civilization have been established. Kol Korran is the patron of traders and merchants, though rogues and thieves also worship his darker aspects. Though loyal to the Host, Kol Korran frequently schemes and lays plots to enrich himself, often at the expense of other members of the Host.

Kol Korran is the son of Olladra and Onatar and is often depicted as a cheerful, fat human or dwarf and occasionally as a white dragon laying atop a pile of ice blue gems.

## Olladra

Olladra is a goddess of the Sovereign Host. The Sovereign of Feast and Good Fortune, Olladra is the wife of Onatar and the mother of Kol Korran and the Keeper. She is worshiped by bards, rogues, gamblers, hedonists, merchants and any who seek good fortune. Even her most devout Vassals can not come to grips with why she chooses to bless or curse on a whim.

Olladra is depicted as a young halfling, an elderly human, or a black dragon.

## Onatar

The Sovereign of Forge and Flame Onatar is revered by smiths, craftsmen, artificers, dwarves and even a small portion of warforged. Wizards and Psions tied closely to the forces of fire also revere Onatar. It is he who introduced tools and weapons to the mortal races and continues to encourage people to improve upon them. Legend also states that it was he who gave fire to the mortals to help them through the cold winters.
